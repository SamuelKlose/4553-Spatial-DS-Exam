Was python a good language for this course? Would you like to use another, or a mix?

Answer: Python worked alright in the course but made it a bit harder to debug code when implementing these new data structures. I would prefer to have done it in C++/Java.


Should I have concentrated more on the "data structures" and less on writing programs to use the structures? Meaning should I have made an attempt to add to the 4 main structures we covered.

Answer: I liked writing the programs, so perhaps a bit more focus on coding.


Were there enough? Or not enough programs for the semester?

Answer: A few more programs would have been helpful.


I already now I should grade programs faster so you don't need to comment on that. I also know my knowledge of the subject matter could be better. I plan on working on both.

Answer: 


Did you turn in all your programs? If not why, and how many did you get working?

Answer: Yes I turned in all of the programs. 


What is your assumed grade in this course? Meaning based on what you completed, what do you think you earned.

Is this the same, or different than what you thought your grade would be at the start of the semester?

Answer: Slightly lower than I thought.
